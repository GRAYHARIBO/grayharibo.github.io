	üëã Hello there, I'm <b>Dongsu Choi</b>! Welcome to my personal website.
	I am a senior undergraduate student at Seoul National University (SNU), majoring in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Material Science & Engineering. My academic and research journey has taken me from Seoul to Germany and back, with the goal of developing innovative bioelectronics and robotic solutions to help people live healthier and more connected lives.

<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<p>My core research interests are in:</p>
<p><strong>Soft Bioelectronics</strong> for health monitoring and therapeutic applications, focusing on skin-integrated and stretchable sensors for seamless biological interfaces</p>
<p><strong>Biointeractive Organic Electronics</strong>: Developing organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors (OMIECs) and other flexible bioelectronic materials for wearable and implantable devices</p>


<p>Through my various projects, I have delved into neuroelectronics, robotic applications, soft actuators, and soft sensors‚Äîall driven by a desire to bridge technology to assist human life.</p>

<h2>Education & Experience</h2>
<p>After gaining foundational engineering knowledge at SNU, I was fortunate to participate in an exchange program at RWTH Aachen University in Germany, where I interned in the <a href="https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/ibi/ibi-3/organization/neuroelectronic-interfaces-nei">Neuroelectronic Interfaces Research Group</a>. This experience allowed me to contribute to microfluidic systems and deepen my understanding of bioelectronics. Currently, I am working in Professor <strong>Tae-Woo Lee's</strong> <a href="https://www.pnel.snu.ac.kr/">Printed, Flexible Nano, Neuromorphic & Energy Electronics Laboratory</a> at SNU, developing a robotic hand powered by organic semiconductor devices.</p>

<p>My previous internships include working on autonomous vehicle perception models and soft tactile sensors in labs under Professors <strong>Kyongsu Yi</strong>, <strong>Yong-Lae Park</strong>, and <strong>Kyungwon Han</strong>. With Professor Kyongsu Yi, I focused on integrating LiDAR data with camera perception models to improve autonomous driving systems. In Professor <a href="https://softrobotics.snu.ac.kr/">Yong-Lae Park</a>'s lab, I developed soft tactile sensors aimed at wearable robotics applications. Under Professor <a href="https://hero.snu.ac.kr/">Kyungwon Han</a>'s guidance, I worked on designing pneumatic soft actuators for heart failure prevention. These interdisciplinary experiences provided me with a diverse skill set in robotics, biomedical engineering, and autonomous systems.</p>


<h2>Beyond Academics</h2>
<p>Outside of academics, I'm an active member of the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/snu_swimming/?hl=ko">SNU Swimming Club</a> üèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, where I serve as Vice Captain. I particularly enjoy water sports like scuba diving and freediving‚ÄîI even hold several certifications! Additionally, I‚Äôve been part of a cultural exchange program at SNU, where I help international students adjust to Korean life. I previously participated in a musical club and was involved in preparing two full musical performances.</p>

<p>My interests in exploring new cultures, movies, and performing arts have given me a well-rounded perspective on life and academia. If you have similar interests or are in the area, definitely feel free to reach out!</p>
