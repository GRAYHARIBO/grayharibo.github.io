	Hi there, I'm <b>Jehan Yang</b>. Thank you for your interest! I am currently an MS student at Caltech in Electrical Engineering, and I just finished my BS at UC Berkeley in Mechanical Engineering. My interest is in working on impactful robotics!  
</p >

My previous work involved *biomimetic robotics*, which I thoroughly enjoyed working on. The complex dynamic systems created by nature are not only inspiring, but effective engineering solutions!

See my previous work here:

* [Salto](url)
* [Soft Robotic Joint](url)
* [Biomimetic Finger](url)

In the future, I would like to work on robotic solutions that directly help people, especially in the medical field. I will be applying for PhD programs in the Fall of 2020 and hope to join an awesome lab.

## Miscellaneous

Of course, I'm not just interested in working all the time. My amateur interests outside of engineering are listening to and producing EDM, drawing people, volunteering as an EMT, watching anime, and helping URM in higher education. I'd really like to get more into MMA and making music, so definitely feel free to reach out and talk if you have similar interests and/or you're in the area!
