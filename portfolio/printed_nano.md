  Undergraduate Research Intern, Jul. 2024 â€“ Present<br> 
  The <a href="https://www.pnel.snu.ac.kr/">Printed, Flexible Nano, Neuromorphic & Energy Electronics Laboratory (PNEL)</a> at Seoul National University specializes in Neuromorphic Semiconductor Bioelectronics. Under the supervision of <strong>Prof. Tae-Woo Lee</strong>, I am collaborating with Kwan-Nyeong Kim and Seung-Woo Lee on Organic Semiconductor Devices and their applications in robotics.

At PNEL, I am focusing on learning the fundamental techniques of organic semiconductor fabrication, with a particular emphasis on electrolyte material. Specifically, my research investigates how material additions in electrolyte affect the ion conduction, retention, and stretchability of synaptic devices. 

To explore the robotic applications of synaptic devices, I am currently working on designing and building a robotic hand. This robotic hand is being integrated with organic semiconductors, and I am developing the analog circuitry required for seamless fusion with the synaptic devices.
