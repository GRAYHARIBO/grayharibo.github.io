The biomimetic finger project is a project led by me in the <a href="gu.berkeley.edu">Gu Research Group</a> at UC Berkeley with Professor Grace X. Gu. I have led this project from the proposal to the prototype with advising from Professor Gu. In addition, this project is funded and aided by the amazing <a href="hsp.berkeley.edu">Haas Scholars Fellowship</a>.

The biomimetic finger project uses concepts from robotics and biology such as tendon-based actuation, compliant mechanisms, and underactuation to achieve advantages optimized by nature. During the summer of 2020 I will be working on gathering results and writing a paper based on this work. 

This work was made possible by the Haas Scholars Fellowship, which awards the largest undergraduate research award at UC Berkeley to 20 high-performing seniors. This group of 20 is made into a cohort that share their research experiences, feedback, and lives together for an unmatchable experience.
