 The Nerf Prosthetic was a UC Berkeley class project for ME 102B. This capstone project was voted the Best Project of the semesterof Fall 2018, which included a cash award. I worked with a great team of five mechanical engineering students.

I worked as the technical lead for this project, which involved building a polished automatic Nerf Prosthetic. By optimizing important specifications, such as weight, cost, and performance, my team built a Nerf Prosthetic that was reliable and robust enough to perform well during a showcase presentation. 

The technical side of this project includes:

* Power Management
* Motor Controller Programming
* Digital Signal Processing
* Usage of Biosensor
* Jamming Reduction

This project required fine-tuning and high-level project management to produce a reliable and robust product.
