My work with Salto has been published in ICRA, a high-impact robotics publication. <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu//~ronf/PAPERS/jlee-icra18.pdf"><em> "Self-Engaging Spined Gripper with Dynamic Peneration and Release for Steep Jumps"</em></a> explores the design of a passive mechanism to be used on the foot of a monoped robot. I spent about 250 hours on collecting and organizing the data, along with giving input on and building the foot and experimental design.
