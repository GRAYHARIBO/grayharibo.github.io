Undergraduate Research Intern, Mar. 2023 – Aug. 2023  <br>
The <a href="https://www.neuroelectronicinterfaces.rwth-aachen.de/">Neuroelectronic Interfaces Research Group (NEI)</a> at RWTH Aachen University specializes in organic bioelectronics, including Organic Electrochemical Transistors (OECTs) and neural interfaces. Under the supervision of <strong>Prof. Francesca Santoro</strong>, I collaborated with researchers to develop a microfluidic system for synthesizing PEDOT:PSS films, focusing on optimizing flow rates and material ratios to control film properties.

### Project Background and Objectives

My research aimed to enhance the fabrication of **PEDOT:PSS** films, a conductive polymer commonly used in OECTs for neural interfaces. Traditional methods relied on immersing ITO glass in a fixed solution, limiting control over the deposition process. This internship involved designing a **microfluidic system** that allowed dynamic control over **flow rates** and **solution composition**, enabling precise adjustments to film conductivity and surface characteristics.

### Microfluidic System Design and Fabrication

The microfluidic setup included several key design and fabrication steps:

- **3D Mold Design**: Using Solidworks, I designed PDMS molds tailored for a secure fit with ITO glass electrodes. The design included spacing considerations to prevent electrode contact, a **draft angle** for easier mold removal, and an **internal mixing structure** for solution homogeneity.
- **PDMS Mold Fabrication**: I fabricated the molds using a resin 3D printer, followed by **Parylene C coating** to ensure smooth demolding and enhance PDMS curing near mold walls.

### Experimental Setup and Findings

To evaluate the effects of **flow rate** and **mixing ratios** on PEDOT:PSS film quality, I conducted two main experiments:

1. **Flow Rate Experiment**:
   - Examined the relationship between flow rates (1 mL/min, 0.2 mL/min, and 0.04 mL/min) and film deposition quality. Higher flow rates led to scratches near the inlet, while lower rates improved film uniformity.

2. **Mixing Ratio Experiment**:
   - Used two inlets for EDOT and PSS solutions, adjusting ratios from 1:1.5 to 1:6. Optimal deposition was observed at a 1:2.25 EDOT:PSS ratio, though the 1:6 ratio highlighted challenges in achieving uniform mixing.

### Technical Skills and Equipment Utilized

- **Cyclic Voltammetry**: For electrodeposition monitoring and ensuring consistent PEDOT:PSS film quality.
- **PDMS Curing**: Used a vacuum chamber and curing oven to eliminate air pockets and ensure uniformity.
- **3D Printing**: Created precise PDMS molds for the microfluidic system.

### Reflections and Takeaways

This internship enriched my understanding of **organic bioelectronics** and **neural interfaces**, particularly in the context of PEDOT:PSS’s role in OECTs. My time at NEI allowed me to gain hands-on experience with interdisciplinary research, blending **mechanical design** and **biomaterials chemistry**. This experience further solidified my interest in neuroelectronics and its applications in neural interfaces.
