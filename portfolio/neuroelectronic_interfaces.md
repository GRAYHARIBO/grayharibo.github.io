<h1>Neuroelectronic Interfaces Research Group (NEI)</h1>
<p><strong>Undergraduate Research Intern (Advisor: Prof. Francesca Santoro)</strong></p>
<p>RWTH Aachen University, Mar. 2023 â€“ Aug. 2023</p>

<h2>Topic: Development of Microfluidics System for Electrodeposition of PEDOT:PSS</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Designed a microfluidics system for the fabrication of PEDOT:PSS film, enabling active adjustment of the ratio between EDOT and PSS during polymerization</li>
  <li>Analyzed the effect of flow rate in the polymerization of PEDOT:PSS and determined the optimal flow rate and molar ratio of EDOT to PSS</li>
  <li>Participated in a seminar discussing organic electrochemical transistor, bioelectronics, and neural interfaces</li>
</ul>
