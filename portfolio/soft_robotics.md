<p>Seoul National University, Jun. 2022 – Nov. 2022</p>

<h2>Topic: Development of Soft Inductive Tactile Sensors for Wearable Robotics</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Developed and tested soft tactile sensors incorporating a Hall sensor and neodymium magnet to measure normal and shear stress for a joint research project with KAIST on wearable suit skin stresses</li>
  <li>Investigated the effects of conductive films on soft inductive tactile sensors’ flexibility and signal amplification ratio using eddy current effect</li>
  <li>Proposed a new fabrication method for e-Gain film by spraying e-Gain on graphene nanofiber to prevent the island effect for high electrical conductance</li>
</ul>
