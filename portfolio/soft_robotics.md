## Topic: Development of Soft Inductive Tactile Sensors for Wearable Robotics

In the **Soft Robotics & Bionics Laboratory**, I engaged in research focused on enhancing the functionality of wearable robotics through tactile sensing. With Ph.D. candidate Byungjun Jeon as my mentor, I contributed to two main projects that centered on using different mechanisms to measure stress on wearable devices.

### 1. Hall Sensor-Based Tactile Sensor for Stress Measurement

This project aimed to measure **normal** and **shear stress** on the skin through a sensor design incorporating **four Hall sensors** and a **neodymium magnet** embedded within a silicone structure. By calibrating the sensor distances, I created a sensor capable of accurately measuring stress on various areas, which could be applied to wearable suits for precise feedback in soft robotics. I fabricated approximately 100 units of this sensor to validate its design and functionality.

### 2. Soft Inductive Tactile Sensors Using Eddy Currents

The second project focused on stress measurement through **inductive sensing**, leveraging a spiral inductor circuit with a conductive film overlay. Stress on the wearable sensor changes the relative position of the spiral and film, inducing eddy currents that alter the impedance. Inspired by [Kawasetsu et al. (2018)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8372916), I experimented with different **conductive film materials** and **geometries** to improve the sensor's sensitivity.

- **Material Testing**: I evaluated copper, e-Gain, and graphene as conductive films. While copper was conductive but rigid, e-Gain offered a balance of flexibility and high conductance, making it ideal for this application.
- **Shape Variation and Molding**: We created various molds (circular, rectangular, and triangular) to analyze the impact of shape on the sensor’s accuracy and response.
- **Fabrication Challenges**: Achieving consistent thickness was challenging due to the **island effect** in e-Gain films. Through experimentation, I developed a **spray coating method** to achieve uniform coating and reduce conductance losses.

### Academic Engagement and Journal Club

The lab’s weekly **journal club** was a platform for discussing research papers across diverse fields, from **soft robotics** to **computer science** and **bioelectronics**. I presented “On the Mechanisms of Biocompatibility,” which focused on the considerations for biocompatible materials in bio-integrated robotic systems. This environment fostered a deeper understanding of robotics and helped cultivate a broader, interdisciplinary perspective on technology's role in improving human life.

### Equipment Frequently Used

- **3D Printer**: Used for precise fabrication of sensor molds.
- **Silicone Curing Oven**: Essential for curing silicone used in sensor designs.
- **Vacuum Chamber**: For air removal and material curing to ensure sensor quality.
- **Arduino**: Used to control and gather data from analog circuits within sensor setups.
- **Mark-10 Force Gauge**: For testing and validating sensor force measurements.

### Reflections and Takeaways

Working in the **Soft Robotics & Bionics Laboratory** solidified my understanding of bio-inspired and wearable robotics. I gained hands-on experience in designing, fabricating, and testing flexible sensors, expanding my technical skills in **sensor technology** and **material science**. This internship deepened my interest in robotics that directly supports individuals and heightened my awareness of the interdisciplinary applications of **soft robotics** in human-assistance technologies.
