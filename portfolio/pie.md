 <a href="pierobotics.org">Pioneers in Engineering</a> (PiE) is a non-profit robotics outreach organization at UC Berkeley. I worked as a leader by building up the mechanical team from one to fifteen people, and now serve as the treasurer. PiE is an organization working on goals close to my heart; we work with local high schools that most need STEM mentorship in the Oakland area and beyond.

When I was mechanical lead in PiE I worked on creating cost-effective robot parts, arranging weeks-long machining schedules, and outsourcing production to the UK, Northeast US, and China. Parts I worked on include:

* Aluminum Sheet Metal
* Modular Bearing Assemblies
* Custom Gears
* Electronic Enclosures
* Sourcing Motors

These robot parts are used in robot kits that high school students use to build robots for a robot competition every Spring. Through iteration, the cost of the robot mechanical kit was reduced by 50% and positive feedback was improved by 75% during my time as a lead. 

Today, I still work as treasurer for PiE, working on financial statements, funding, and taxes. If you want your money to go as far as possible in making an impact on disparate STEM education in the East Bay, make a tax-deductible [donation to PiE!](https://pierobotics.org/support-pie/)
